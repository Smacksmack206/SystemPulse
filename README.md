SystemPulse: A Comprehensive System Utility and Monitoring Tool
SystemPulse is a modern, all-in-one, real-time system monitoring and utility tool designed for developers, system administrators, and power users who need a comprehensive overview of their machine's performance and the ability to manage various system aspects from a single, intuitive interface.

The Problem
In today's complex computing environments, managing and monitoring system resources, network connections, running processes, and various other system-level tasks often requires juggling multiple command-line tools and utilities. This can be cumbersome, inefficient, and lacks a unified, user-friendly interface for visualizing and interacting with system data.

The Solution
SystemPulse provides a clean, modern, and highly interactive web-based dashboard that consolidates a wide range of system utilities into one place. With SystemPulse, you can:

Monitor Core System Metrics: Keep a close eye on CPU, memory, and disk usage in real-time.

Analyze Network Activity: View active network connections, and in the future, analyze network interfaces and perform common network diagnostics.

Manage Processes: View a list of running processes with their CPU and memory consumption, and terminate processes with a single click.

Analyze Disk Usage: Quickly identify large files on your system to free up disk space.

And much more: The modular design of SystemPulse allows for the easy addition of new features and functionalities.

Why I Built SystemPulse
I created SystemPulse to address the need for a centralized and intuitive system monitoring tool. As a developer, I often found myself switching between different terminals and commands to get a complete picture of my system's health. I wanted to build a tool that not only visualizes this data in a clean and modern way but also provides the tools to act on that information immediately. This project is a demonstration of my ability to design and build a full-stack application that is both functional and user-friendly.

Who is this for?
Developers: To monitor resource usage of their applications and debug performance issues.

System Administrators: To get a quick overview of system health and manage processes and network connections.

Power Users: Who want more insight into their system's performance and a powerful set of tools to manage it.

Technical Recruiters: This project showcases a wide range of skills including front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; back-end development with Python and FastAPI; and system-level programming with the psutil library.

Features
Real-time System Monitoring: CPU, memory, and disk usage at a glance.

Process Management: View and kill running processes.

Network Connection Viewer: See all active network connections.

Large File Scanner: Find and delete large files to free up space.

Themable Interface: Choose from multiple themes to customize the look and feel of the dashboard.

Responsive Design: The dashboard is designed to work on various screen sizes.

Future Plans: SystemPulse for macOS
I am excited to announce that I am in the process of developing a native macOS version of SystemPulse. This will be a polished, feature-rich application available on the Mac App Store as a SaaS product. The macOS version will leverage native frameworks to provide an even more seamless and integrated experience, with additional features such as:

Enhanced UI/UX: A refined and polished user interface that feels right at home on macOS.

Deeper System Integration: Tighter integration with macOS for more detailed system information and control.

Advanced Features: Additional tools for power users, including advanced network analysis, container management, and more.

Stay tuned for more updates on the upcoming macOS release!
